# flic
Easy Inter-process communication via TCP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nkcmr/flic.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nkcmr/flic)
[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/nkcmr/flic.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/nkcmr/flic)

# Install
via git:
```bash
 [root@localhost ~] npm install git://github.com/nkcmr/flic
```

or npm
```bash
 [root@localhost ~] npm install flic
```

# Usage
```javascript
var flic = require('flic');
var Bridge = flic.bridge;
var Node = flic.node;

// Default port is 8221

// Bridge can be in any process, and nodes can be in any process
var bridge = new Bridge();

var node1 = new Node('node1', function(err){
  if(err) return handleError(err);

	// Successfully connected to Bridge
	console.log('node1 online!');
});

node1.on('event', function(param1, callback){
	// do awesomeness	
	console.log(param1); // -> 'flic_is_easy'

	//send a callback fig.1
	callback(null, 'ilovenodejs');
});
```
Somewhere else, far far away!

```javascript
// Make anonymous nodes by not giving it a name
// Anonymous nodes:
// Cannot be told (Node.tell) anything
// Can tell other nodes
// Can receive shouts
// Helps avoid duplicate node names

var anonymous_node = new Node(function(err){
  if(err) return handleError(err);

	console.log('somenode online!');
});

anonymous_node.tell('node1:event', 'flic_is_easy', function(err, param2){
  if(err) return handleError(err);

	console.log(param2); // -> 'ilovenodejs'
});

```

# Concept
flics intended solution is to be able to send arbitrary data in between seperated proccesses without a whole lot of fuss. There are existing inter-process messaging APIs already built into node (between parent and child processes) but this can hook up any locally running node processes fairly easily.

# API
### Node
A node is an endpoint that can be reached by other nodes. Exposed by `require('flic').node`
#### new Node( [name], [port], [callback] )
Creates a new instance of `Node`

- `name [string]` (optional) A name for the node, so that it can be contacted by other nodes, if none is specified, the node will be assigned a random name and be **anonymous**. Anonymous nodes cannot be reached by other nodes, but can receive shouts.
- `port [number]` (optional, defaults to 8221) The port number of the Bridge.
- `callback [function]` (optional) A callback that will be called when the node is done trying to connect with the Bridge. Callback will be called with only one error parameter, if `null`, the node is successfully connected.

#### node#tell( who_what, [args...], [callback] )
Tell another node about an event

- `who_what [string]` (required) the inteded target of the tell. For example if you wanted to reach the `cache` node and tell it to `get` something, this parameter would be `cache:get`. To tell `webworker` to `suspend`, it would be `webworker:suspend`.
- `args [mixed]` (optional) Put any arguments that need to be sent to the remote node. Example: When calling `node.tell("webworker:suspend", "now", 0, function(){});` the web worker's suspend event will receive `"now"` and `0` as parameters.
- `callback [function]` (optional) If the remote node decideds to reply via callback, this is the function that will be called. (expect the first parameter to be an error, if one occured)

#### node#shout( event_name, [args...] )
Tell all connected nodes about an event

- `event_name [string]` (required) The event to broadcast.
- `args [mixed]` (optional) any arguments that the receivers of the shout should receive.

Node instances also inherit the node.js EventEmitter, so when other nodes tell a node about an event, you can attach a listener of that event like you would with the EventEmitter. Example:

```javascript
var node1 = new Node('node1', function(){ 
    console.log('online'); 
});
node1.on('my_event', function(param1, callback){
    console.log(param1); // -> 'ilovenodejs'
    callback(null, 'me too!');
});

var anon_node = new Node(function(){
    console.log('Anonymous node is online.');
    this.tell('node1:my_event', 'ilovenodejs', function(err, param1){
       console.log(param1); // -> 'me too!' 
    });
});
```

**Note about callbacks: ** All callbacks should use the 'error-first' style, because if an error occurs with flic, it will notify not only through the callbacks, but using the first parameter to tell which error has occurred.

### Bridge

The bridge is what it sounds like, it is merely a bridge between the nodes, not very much logic or work goes into the bridge. Exposed by `require('flic').bridge`

#### new Bridge( [port] )
Creates a new instance of `Bridge`

- `port [number]` (optional, defaults to 8221) A port number for the bridge to listen on.

#### Bridge#close( [args...] )
Closes the bridge and sends any data to connected nodes.

- `args [mixed]` (optional) any data to be sent to connected nodes upon close.
